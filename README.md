Ideally this project is started on a machine preppared for Laravel 10 development. If ready entering "php artisan serve" in the commandline at the project root should wake things up.

Short of that, the main files worked on are ./resources/views/welcome.blade.php and ./public/css/checkers.css

This project is young. Next steps are basic JS game logic to test local play, followed by a complete PHP ruleset to facilitate remote play.
